# Partisan News Viewer

This tool aims to create a news feed from sources at different points on the idealogical spectrum. The ratings used to determine these groupings and ordering of bias are pulled from Ad Fontes Media’s Bias Chart. These ratings do not reflect my own beliefs and are the result of work done by the independent group with describes itself as “a public benefit corporation with a mission to make news consumers smarter and news media better”. This project uses these ratings to attempt to show the extent of the informational divide that exists between partisan media outlets.
